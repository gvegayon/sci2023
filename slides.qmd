## Whoami

- Research Assistant Professor of Epidemiology.

- Ph.D. in Biostatistics from USC and M.Sc. in Economics from Caltech.

- Methodologist working at the intersection between Statistical Computing and Complex Systems Modeling.

# Network visualization with netplot

::: {.absolute bottom=-200 right=0}
You can download the slides from<br>[ggv.cl/slides/sci2023](https://ggv.cl/slides/sci2023)
:::

## **netplot** In a nutshell

- **What**: An R package for network visualization inspired by [Gephi](https://gephi.org).

- **Why**: Opinionated way to visualize graphs.

- **Where**: You can get the dev version on GitHub ([USCCANA/netplot](https://github.com/USCCANA/netplot)) or the stable version on CRAN.

## Main features

- Visualization engine: The `grid` system (same used by [`ggplot2`]().)

- Layout algorithms: Default uses `igraph`'s layout.

- Vertex sizes: Relative to the drawing area.

## Example code+output


## Challenges and Next steps

- Speed up the code: `grid` objects can be computationally expensive to build.

- Porter Bischof (Undergrad from UVU) will contribute and present at the INSNA Sunbelt conference (flagship conference of SNA).

# Counting motifs with barry

## **barry** in a nutshell

- **What**: A C++ header-only template library for motif counting (and more.)

- **Why**: Implement Discrete Exponential Family Models [DEFMs] for phylogenetics and social networks analysis.

- **Where**: You can get it on GitHub ([USCBiostats/barry](https://github.com/USCbiostats/barry))

## Main features

About 11 K lines of C++ code built for statistical modeling:

- Motif count using change statistics (we will return to that.)

- Full and constrained enumeration of 0/1 arrays.

- Computes probability function for Discrete Exponential-Family Models [DEFMs].

- Memory and computationally efficient for pooled models.


## Current implemented models

- Exponential-Family Random Graph Models [**ERGMs**].

- **DEFMs** for multiple correlated outcomes (Markov Random Fields; on development with Drs. [MJ Pugh](https://medicine.utah.edu/internal-medicine/epidemiology/research-programs/torch) and [Tom Valente](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/thomas-william-valente/).)

- Motif counting applied to counting **"*imaginary motifs*"** in Cognitive Social Structures [CSS] (with [Dr. Kyosuke Tanaka](https://kyosuketanaka.com/), submitted to [Social Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/social-networks)).

- Modeling the **evolution of gene functions** in terms of transition between functional states (research grant submitted to National Human Genome Research Institute [NHGRI](https://genome.gov)).

# Final words

## Today's talk

- The netplot R package for graph visualization.

- barry: Your go-to motif accountant.
