# Network visualization with netplot

::: {.absolute bottom=-200 right=0}
You can download the slides from<br>[ggv.cl/slides/sci2023](https://ggv.cl/slides/sci2023)
:::

## **netplot** In a nutshell

- **What**: An R package for network visualization inspired by [Gephi](https://gephi.org).

- **Why**: Opinionated way to visualize graphs.

- **Where**: You can get the dev version on GitHub ([USCCANA/netplot](https://github.com/USCCANA/netplot)) or the stable version on CRAN.

## Main features

- Visualization engine: The `grid` system (same used by [`ggplot2`]().)

- Layout algorithms: Default uses `igraph`'s layout.

- Vertex sizes: Relative to the drawing area.

## Example code+output


## Challenges and Next steps

- Speed up the code: `grid` objects can be computationally expensive to build.

- Porter Bischof (Undergrad from UVU) will contribute and present at the INSNA Sunbelt conference (flagship conference of SNA).

# Counting motifs with barry

## **barry** in a nutshell

- **What**: A C++ header-only template library for motif counting (and more.)

- **Why**: Implement Discrete Exponential Family Models [DEFMs] for phylogenetics and social networks analysis.

- **Where**: You can get it on GitHub ([USCBiostats/barry](https://github.com/USCbiostats/barry))

## Main features

About 11 K lines of C++ code built for statistical modeling:

- Motif count using change statistics (we will return to that.)

- Full and constrained enumeration of 0/1 arrays.

- Computes probability function for Discrete Exponential-Family Models [DEFMs].

- Memory and computationally efficient for pooled models.

## Change statistics

- Change statistics are at the core of ERGMs (Exponential-Family Random Graph Models).

- Two great applications:(i) make counting easy and (ii) can be used for sampling from ERGM likelihood function.

## Change statistics formals

- The change statistic is defined as a real-valued vector where the $k$-th entry equals the observed change when the $ij$-th tie is removed from the network. Formally:

    $$
    \delta(y_{ij}: 0\to 1) = s(\mathbf{y})_{ij}^+ - s(\mathbf{y})_{ij}^-
    $$

  Where $s(\cdot)$ is a function returning graph $\mathbf{y}$'s observed statistics, and $s(\mathbf{y})_{ij}^+$ represents its value when $y_{ij} = 1$.

## Examples of change statistics

- Number of edges:

- Reciprocity (mutuality):

- Transitive triples:

- Gender homophily:


## Current implemented models

- Exponential-Family Random Graph Models [**ERGMs**].

- **DEFMs** for multiple correlated outcomes (Markov Random Fields; on development with Drs. [MJ Pugh](https://medicine.utah.edu/internal-medicine/epidemiology/research-programs/torch) and [Tom Valente](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/thomas-william-valente/).)

- Motif counting applied to counting **"*imaginary motifs*"** in Cognitive Social Structures [CSS] (with [Dr. Kyosuke Tanaka](https://kyosuketanaka.com/), submitted to [Social Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/social-networks)).

- Modeling the **evolution of gene functions** in terms of transition between functional states (research grant submitted to National Human Genome Research Institute [NHGRI](https://genome.gov)).

## ERGMs

::: {.columns style="font-size: 24pt"}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- A fundamental feature of pooled models (multiple graphs/arrays).
- A single model may feature thousands of networks.
- But if all have the same number of nodes (and other features)... we only need to enumerate once.
